# utility_scripts

A collection of general-purpose code that makes my life easier.

## Contents

#### fileutilities.py

Batch tasks of file-munging that I seem to need frequently enough to merit automation (listing, linking, delimited merging, command looping). Works as script or library.  (python 2.7.3)

A partial testing suite available in test_fileutilities.py.

#### mylogs.py

Custom logging of commands and messages. Works as library or command-wrapping script. Just to log of commands in a consistent format. Aids memory and reproducibility of analyses. (python 2.7.3)
